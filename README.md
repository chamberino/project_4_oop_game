# project_4_oop_game

A browser-based, word guessing game.

The game is created using OOP. There are 3 JS files. Game.js and Phrase.js contain the classes which have properties and methods that select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

The Game object contains all methods, properties and values necessary for managing the game, and a Phrase class to help with creating an array of Phrase objects.

App.js creates a new Game object, initializes and starts the game, and event listeners are added to the onscreen keyboard as well as the players keyboard.
